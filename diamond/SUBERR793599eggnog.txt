Necessary for proper vacuole morphology. Plays an important role in osmotically-induced vacuole fragmentation. Required for cytoplasm to vacuole transport (Cvt) vesicle formation, pexophagy and starvation-induced autophagy. Involved in correct atg9 trafficking to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Might also be involved in premeiotic DNA replication (By similarity);
